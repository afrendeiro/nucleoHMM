nucleoHMM
=======
### Hidden Markov Model-based nucleossome positioning prediction

# Running
This program has been tested in Python 3 and does not require any additional packages.

Example usage to predict nucleossome positioning for all sequences in input file:

    `python3 nucleoHMM.py tests/seq.fa`

# Training the model
nucleoHMM provides two na√Øve models based on single- and dinucleotide frequencies.

You can train either using a file with nucleotide positions and bound states in a tab-delimited file (see Output and an example in tests/yeast_chr1.tsv).

Pass file to train as argument of 't' and specify the nucleotide model ("single" or "dinucleotide") as argument to 'm':

    `python3 nucleoHMM.py -t tests/yeast_chr1.tsv -m dinucleotide tests/yeast_chr1_500.tsv`

To exclusively train the model and exit, add the `--train-only` flag:

    python3 nucleoHMM.py -t tests/yeast_chr1.tsv -m single --train-only

## Generating random training set
Supply an integer argument to the '-g' option to generate random training data with that length:

    `python3 nucleoHMM.py -g 10000`

# Input
nucleoHMM accepts [FASTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files as input. It supports only the DNA alphabet (A,C,G,T).

# Output
nucleoHMM outputs one tab-delimited file for each sequence with nucleotide positions and bound states.

Output files are named as the fasta identifier. If empty, files will be named based on sequence number with the following prefix: 'NucleoHMM_seq<seqnumber>.tsv'

Output directory can be specified with the -o option.

When training model on data, nucleoHMM saves the model in binary format but also in human-readable JSON.

# Other options
Run `python3 nucleoHMM.py` to see all options.
